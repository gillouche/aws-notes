## Benefits and features

Code with just a browser:
* AWS Cloud9 gives you the flexibility to run your development environment on a managed Amazon EC2 instance or any existing Linux server that supports SSH. 
* This means that you can write, run, and debug applications with just a browser, without needing to install or maintain a local IDE. 
* The Cloud9 code editor and integrated debugger include helpful, time-saving features such as code hinting, code completion, and step-through debugging. 
* The Cloud9 terminal provides a browser-based shell experience enabling you to install additional software, do a git push, or enter commands.

Code together in real-time:
* AWS Cloud9 makes collaborating on code easy. 
* You can share your development environment with your team in just a few clicks and pair program together. 
* While collaborating, your team members can see each other type in real time, and instantly chat with one another from within the IDE. 

Build serverless applications with ease:

* AWS Cloud9 makes it easy to write, run, and debug serverless applications.
* It preconfigures the development environment with all the SDKs, libraries, and plug-ins needed for serverless development.
* Cloud9 also provides an environment for locally testing and debugging AWS Lambda functions.
* This allows you to iterate on your code directly, saving you time and improving the quality of your code.

Direct terminal access to AWS:

* AWS Cloud9 comes with a terminal that includes sudo privileges to the managed Amazon EC2 instance that is hosting your development environment and a preauthenticated AWS Command Line Interface.
* This makes it easy for you to quickly run commands and directly access AWS services.

Start new projects quickly:
* AWS Cloud9 makes it easy for you to start new projects.
* Cloud9’s development environment comes prepackaged with tooling for over 40 programming languages, including Node.js, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, and C++.
* This enables you to start writing code for popular application stacks within minutes by eliminating the need to install or configure files, SDKs, and plug-ins for your development machine.
* Because Cloud9 is cloud-based, you can easily maintain multiple development environments to isolate your project’s resources.
