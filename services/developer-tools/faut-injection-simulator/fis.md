# AWS Fault Injection Simulator

## General Info
AWS Fault Injection Simulator is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS.

Makes it easier to improve an applicationâ€™s performance, observability, and resiliency.

Fault injection experiments are used in chaos engineering, which is the practice of stressing an application in testing or production environments by creating disruptive events.

Fault injection experiment helps teams create the real-world conditions needed to uncover the hidden bugs, monitoring blind spots, and performance bottlenecks that are difficult to find in distributed systems.
